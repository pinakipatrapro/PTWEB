At any point in time, some of these programs have very targeted functional and business purposes and some are required for legal or internal policy compliance. Others, however, are out of date or have no or low utilization or are duplicative (similar content from different vendors or internally developed programs covering same topic in different parts of the organization). Still others may be libraries or collections of professional and technical skills courses with no specific business objective but available generally to support ongoing employee development. Our Learning Portfolio Transformation services helps re-design, re-configure and transform learning portfolios such that they are relevant, are linked to the business and deemed effective and efficient. &nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Value-Added Consulting</strong>
&nbsp;</span>While our Delivery teams are focused on delivering to the contracted SLAs and ensuring service excellence, we offers a Value Added Consulting service which offers an on-demand aligned consultant for more strategic solutions to value add.

</strong></span>&nbsp;The Strategic Training Assessment is a consulting service that served customers who might be interested in outsourcing. Companies have huge budget for L&amp;D.

Our Strategic Training Assessment process is designed to help organization transform L&amp;D from a cost center to an enterprise that adds value to the organization. NIIT works in close partnership with our customers to assess the current state of the training organization, the desired future state, gaps between the two and identify recommendations for helping them move to the desired future state in the organization. &nbsp;</li>

            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Obtaining actionable insights into various aspects of an organizations' functioning and facilitating decision making at all levels, has become perhaps the No 1 priority in recent times. 
<br>The times of economic uncertainty has only accentuated this need. These days, a BI initiative within the company is seen as the pivot to enable alignment of company strategy with execution, tracking KPI's, looking for ways to improving departmental or organization wide performance and significantly maximizing return on a host of IT investments done till date. Pontos has been working with organizations in this key endeavour. 
<br>Pontos has built a strong Business Intelligence practice with experts in data warehousing, data architects who combine business-domain knowledge with technology and deployment consultants who have been involved in a large number of projects. Leveraging an Onsite-Offsite delivery model, Pontos has the ability across all aspects of the program from assessment of Business Intelligence needs, design and implementation of Data Warehousing and creation of a wide spectrum of user specific Dashboards, Reports, Web Intelligence etc. As a SAP Business Objects partner, we would help build a scalable BI Infrastructure that while meeting current needs would grow seamlessly with the organization.
<br><strong><u><br></u></strong><br><strong><u>REPORTING 
</u></strong><br>Today, most organizations face a similar challenge: The information you need exists – but it's stored in disparate, inaccessible sources, in a format that's not usable. Reporting serves as a foundation for a broader BI strategy, helping you provide the most requested information – reliably, securely, and in the required format. 
<br>Search and Navigation 
<br>Simplicity and speed of search define these user-friendly search and navigation tools. Locate information hidden in hundreds of internal and external resources, such as structured databases, business intelligence (BI) systems, unstructured company and text content, search engines, and the web. 
<br>Leverage and extend your organization's existing business intelligence, search, and content investments to increase productivity and insight of your business.<br></p>

<br>
<br>Unparalleled performance 
<br>SAP S/4HANA offers unparalleled performance due to SAP HANA’s in-memory database, enabling users to perform reporting and analytics in real-time on live data, close fiscal periods faster, or identify trends and act upon them before competitors have the chance. It supports innovation through the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, yet simplifies the overall IT landscape, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership. 
<br>S/4HANA is available in three primary flavours: On-premise, Public Cloud or Private Cloud. We are one of just a handful of organisations in the world authorised by SAP to provide solutions across all three, or hybrid. 
<br>
<br>More accurate decision-making 
<br>Our S/4HANA deployments make our clients’ processes run quicker. Our real-time analytics solutions give you more accurate decision-making. We create new data models to significantly reduce the size of your database, leading to performance gains and hardware cost reductions. With simplified data in fewer tables, processes can be performed more simply and reports generated far quicker. 
<br>
<br>Improved user experiences 
<br>We recognise the importance of engaging your internal SAP users and have an army of SAP Fiori experts who can create improved user experiences for your teams. Fiori reduces the volume of key strokes required to perform transactions. Due to being more intuitive, Fiori also reduces training and testing, compared with a traditional SAP ECC solution. SAP’s preferred implementation partner in the S/4HANA space, our S/4HANA team has certified SAP HANA specialists across 33 countries including SAP Mentors and HANA Distinguished Engineers. We are SAP’s preferred implementation partner in the S/4HANA space and are fast becoming the leading S/4HANA subject matter expert and S/4HANA delivery partner in the market. 
<br>
<br>How long does an SAP S/4HANA implementation take? 
<br>Some large enterprises are opting for greenfield projects – seeing the technological innovations as an opportunity to completely rebuild their ERP landscapes from the ground up. Brownfield projects are also an option: in this approach, the customer leaves its IT landscape intact but adopts the new technology to enrich and enhance it. Greenfield and brownfield projects naturally take longer – sometimes even several years and migrating to SAP S/4HANA is only one part of such a project.&nbsp;<br></p>

            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">We are your go-to experts for Fiori, SAPUI5, Design Thinking and SAP Cloud products. 
<br>Flavours of Fiori. Fiori exists at a level where it can be implemented in any appropriate technology, from it’s launch, this has been in the javascript framework SAPUI5 or Open UI5. The introduction of the iOS SDK in 2017 adds a new way of implementing Fiori based designs using Swift and the Apple iOS platform. Surrey County Council improves efficiencies for remote workers with SAP Fiori.&nbsp;As we have embraced the technical revolution of UI5, it has required developing and growing the necessary skills and experience to approach solution design with the appropriate end user focus required to achieve a high quality user experience. 
<br><strong><u><br></u></strong><br><strong><u>UX &amp; Design Thinking 
</u></strong><br>The ultimate goal of a strong Enterprise UX is to leave the user with what feels like a frictionless process - changing the mindset from, for example, putting off a task, to carrying it out as and when required as quickly as possible. 
<br>Embracing the power of Fiori 
<br>We are your go-to experts for Fiori, SAPUI5, Design Thinking and SAP Cloud products. With a wealth of experience, our customers trust us to discover, design, develop and deliver enterprise Fiori portfolios to capitalise on their new and existing system landscapes. 
<br><br><strong><u>SAP UI5 
</u></strong><br>SAPUI5 is a framework for developing apps on the web. The engine that has been quietly powering the Fiori revolution is called the "User Interface Development Toolkit for HTML5", or UI5 for short. It's a framework for development apps on the web. Apps that are role-based, adaptive, coherent, simple and delightful. Those are the key design principles behind Fiori, and it's no surprise, as the development of UI5 itself has been in conjunction with the blossoming of Fiori as a design language and as a set of apps from SAP. Build modern, responsive web apps 
<br>World transforms service operations with SAPUI5 applications. UI5 works on ground level to design world class User interfaces, It's a set of libraries and mechanisms that allow SAP, partners and customers alike to build modern, responsive web applications. UI5 doesn't constrain us to the Fiori design language, but if we want to build according to Fiori principles including HTML and other languages, there's nothing that comes close to what UI5 has to offer. 
<br>
<br><strong><u>At the forefront of the SAPUI5 revolution 
<br></u></strong>SAP made SAPUI5 platform, the SAP- toolkit in February 2012. We were early adopters and a month or two later published an article "SAPUI5 - the future direction of SAP UI development?" that set the scene for the rest of the world. Since then, we have been at the forefront of the UI5 revolution, working with SAP to develop the toolkit, demonstrating thought leadership with conferences globally 
<br>
<br><strong><u>OpenUI5: A stable, capable enterprise-ready toolkit 
<br></u></strong>Alongside SAPUI5 there is a UI5, an Apache 2.0-licensed version which SAP open sourced at the end of 2013 and now develops in parallel to SAPUI5 - in fact, it's the same codebase. Over the years since it was introduced, UI5 has matured into a stable, capable enterprise ready toolkit that we are proud to be recognised as experts in. We've even won awards and keynoted at application development challenge events such as SAP Technologies and the inaugural SAP Architect &amp; Developer Summit on the subject of UI5.&nbsp;<br></p>
